Implementing a WPF Tooltip
This example uses a simple string tooltip for the first button and then a much more advanced one for the second button. In the advanced case, we use a panel as the root control and then we're free to add controls to that as we please. The result is a header, a description text and a hint that you can press F1 for more help, including a help icon.
